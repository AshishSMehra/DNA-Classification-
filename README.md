# DNA-Classification

Creating a DNA classification model using deep learning involves several steps. Here's a roadmap to guide you through the process:

1. Problem Definition and Data Collection
Define the Problem: Clearly specify what type of DNA classification you are aiming for. For example, classifying different species, detecting genetic mutations, or identifying specific genes.
Collect Data: Gather a dataset of DNA sequences relevant to your problem. Public databases like GenBank, ENCODE, or 1000 Genomes Project can be good sources.
